# *** START OF MESSAGE FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS FOR NORMAL USERS ***
# Here the format of the binary data is defined. The keys of the FormatSpec dictionary
# come in groups of 5 (5...9, 10...14, and so on) and each group corresponds to the set of
# messages that can be transmitted by a given AWS (summer, winter, diagnostic, ... see below)
# The BinaryTxFormatRevision setting in the logger program need to match with the keys
# of the FormatDict dictionary, so that BinaryTxFormatRevision = 1 corresponds to keys 5...9
# and BinaryTxFormatRevision = 5 to keys 25...29. This is required because the receiving
# end has no way to tell where and what kind of values are encoded in the binary message.
# The possible value types are as follow:
# f = value encoded as 2 bytes base-10 floating point (GFP2)
# l = value encoded as 4 bytes two's complement integer (GLI4)
# t = timestamp as seconds since 1990-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 encoded as GLI4
# g = GPS time encoded as GLI4
# n = GPS latitude encoded as GLI4
# e = GPS latitude encoded as GLI4
# It is also possible to decode any of these in debug mode which adds to the decoded value the 
# raw bytes as characters, as hex and as bit string, in brackets, e.g. an FP2 values of -1600 
# will be written out as -1600(â€˜ @ = \0\x\E\6 \0\x\40 = 0b11100110 0b01000000) when using 'F' instead 
# of 'f'. Becasue no check is done, a line may get truncated if some special bytes are 
# encountered, probably things like null characters, end of line, escape codes etc. I'm also 
# not sure if/how differently it may work on python 3 or if the data file displays differently 
# based on the locale/character encoding set on the pc.
